# PLPBasicAssignment

I followed the instructions as per the assignment but after pushing to GitHub "git push -u origin main" there were some conflicts because I had an unrelated README file. I then pulled from GitHub "git pull origin main". It then refused to merge then I put in the command "git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories". Then I pushed to GitHub againn "git push -u origin main". And it worked.

I created the hello.txt by using the command "vim hello.txt" and I typed in "Hello, Git!"
